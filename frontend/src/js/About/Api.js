                <p>
                  Used to get information about all of the recent bills
                  sponsored by each representatives and their current
                  status.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> How it was scraped:</b> <br/> We got the API Key
                  from the propublica website. And we used the key to
                  scrape the data about recent Bills. We received the
                  data in a json format and converted that into our
                  Bills model and uploaded it to the PostgresSQL
                  database. All of this is done by a scraper script.

                  Used to get information about all of the U.S.
                  representatives, their party, and corresponding
                  districts.
                </p>
                <b> How it was scraped:</b> <br/> We used GovTrack to
                scrape the data about House Representatives. We did not
                have to get an API key for this. We received all the data
                in a json format and extracted the information about the
                representatives. The information then was converted into
                our Representatives model and uploaded to the PostgresSQL
                database. All of this is done by a scraper script.

                <b> How it was scraped:</b> <br/> The district data
                scraper pulls information from the United State Census
                Bureauâ€™s 2016 American Community Survey by targeting a
                specific list of thirteen data endpoints. For each
                district in each state, we pulled data for each of the
                endpoints and  stored those data points for the the
                scraper converts the data into a District and State model
                and commits the models to the database.
