      "text": "ALBANY, GA (WALB) - The state of Georgia has been allocated $64.9 million in storm recovery money by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nCongressman Sanford Bishop announced Tuesday afternoon that HUD's Community Development Block Grant, Disaster Recovery program will supply the funds.\nThe money is to be used in South and Middle Georgia to help with the recovery from the storms, tornadoes and hurricanes that struck the state in 2017.\nI applaud Secretary Carson and his staff at HUD for their commitment to those areas impacted by the devastating storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes that struck our country in 2017,” said Congressman Bishop. Middle and Southwest Georgia suffered heavy losses after being struck by a series of natural disasters throughout last year, and there remain substantial unmet recovery needs, particularly in Dougherty County. I am confident that the funding from the Community Development Block Grant, Disaster Recovery program will be a boon for the region as it continues to rebuild.\nThe money is for housing and business needs as well as mitigation assistance to protect the area from damage from future storms.\nCopyright 2018 WALB ",

      "text": "MOAA Leaders Prepare to Storm Capitol Hill on Military Issues Share Article Chapter and council leaders of the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) are preparing to gather Wednesday, April 18, for the association’s largest annual grassroots advocacy event: Storming the Hill. Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) is the nation’s largest military officers’ association with more than 350,000 members from every branch of uniformed service. MOAA is a nonprofit and politically nonpartisan organization. ALEXANDRIA, Va.   Chapter and council leaders of the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) are preparing to gather Wednesday, April 18, for the association’s largest annual grassroots advocacy event: Storming the Hill . Divided into teams to visit their states’ legislative delegations on Capitol Hill during the day-long event, they will set out to engage nearly all 535 senators and representatives regarding two important legislative priorities: 1) Ending reduced pay for Chapter 61 retirees. Chapter 61 retirees have been medically retired prior to reaching a 20-year service career with a disability rating of 30 percent or greater. The term “Chapter 61” comes from the corresponding chapter in Title 10 U.S. Code that covers disability retirements. MOAA’s position is that all eligible servicemembers should receive both retirement and disability compensation, which is not the case for Chapter 61 retirees. MOAA supports legislation currently introduced in Congress, in particular H.R. 333, introduced by Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.), which addresses both the Chapter 61 issue and MOAA’s wider legislative priority regarding concurrent receipt. “MOAA's long-held position is that career servicemembers earn retired pay by service alone, and those unfortunate enough to suffer a service-caused disability in the process should have any VA disability compensation added to — not subtracted from — military retired pay,” says Col. Mike Barron, USA (Ret), director of currently serving/retired affairs, MOAA Government Relations. MOAA’s website has more information about its position on Chapter 61 retiree pay. 2) Maintaining military pay and benefits in order to recruit and retain an all-volunteer force. MOAA supports maintaining the military pay and benefits essential to recruiting and retaining the high-quality all-volunteer force necessary to meet the nation’s security and warfighting requirements now and in the future. The president’s proposed 2.6-percent pay raise, as aligned with the Employment Cost Index (ECI), is the largest in nine years, but still just keeps pace with private-sector wage growth for this upcoming fiscal year, leaving the military behind civilian wage growth by, coincidentally, the same margin — 2.6 percent. The only way to close this cumulative gap is to raise military pay above the ECI, as Congress did between 2000 and 2010. “The move to an all-volunteer force has been successful beyond measure,” says Col. Dan Merry, USAF (Ret), vice president of MOAA Government Relations. “Despite unyielding demands on our men and women from all quarters of our country and beyond, our nation’s military remains peerless. We will continue to try and educate the few who believe our all-volunteer force is overpaid and can afford to bear some of the costs of readiness and other programs.” MOAA’s website has more information about its position on military pay. Media inquiries Follow MOAA’s online coverage of Storming the Hill 2018, including news updates, photos, videos, and more. For live updates on the day’s events, follow MOAA on Instagram at @MOAAStorms or on Facebook. Supporters of the event — on the ground and at home — will address tweets @Military Officer and @MOAAStorms, using the hashtag #WhyIStorm and #MOAAStorms. MOAA members from all 50 states will participate. To contact a member from your state or hometown, please contact Alan English at pr@moaa.org. ALABAMA",
